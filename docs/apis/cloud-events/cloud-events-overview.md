# Overview

CloudEvents is a [specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md) for describing event 
data in a common way. CloudEvents seeks to dramatically simplify event declaration and delivery across services, platforms, and beyond!

CloudEvents is a new effort, and it's still under active development. 
However, its working group has received a surprising amount of industry interest, ranging from major cloud providers to 
popular SaaS companies. The specification is now under the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/).

**Miranum Connect** uses this standard to enable other software components to use its functionality / APIs. 
The schema of currently available cloud events is documented in the [Commands](./commands/ActivateJobsRequests) subsection.
