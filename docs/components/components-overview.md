This section contains product manual content for each of the components in Miranum, including conceptual one. 
Miranum consists out of two major components. One is called Connect and the other IDE. Both of them can easily be used 
together or separately.
* [Miranum-IDE](./miranum-ide/intro-miranum-ide): This is an Integrated Development Environment targeted for designing and developing process automation projects. It is build and released as VS Code plugin. It comes with: 
  * Forms - based on JSON Schema 
  * Realtime Collaboration support - via VS Code 
  * Templates - to ease the design of processes and forms. 
* [Miranum-Connect](./miranum-connect/intro-miranum-connect): Connect is a framework which enables its user to build reusable and technology neutral connectors and integrations between products. For that purpose a hexagonal architecture with a strong domain focus is used.
