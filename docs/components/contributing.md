## Miranum Repositories 
As already mentioned, there are multiple ways how you can contribute to Miranum (e.g. bug fixes, documentation improvements, etc.). 
This section should help you understand the different repositories miranum consists of and which technologies they use. 

We distinguish Miranum in four different repositories: 
* [Miranum-IDE](https://github.com/FlowSquad/miranum-ide): Contains all assets used by the Visual Studio Code plugins as well as the Miranum CLI, mostly written in TypeScript. 
* [Miranum-Connect](https://github.com/FlowSquad/miranum): Contains the framework for building reusable integrations, written in Java.

* [Miranum-Consulting](https://github.com/FlowSquad/miranum-consulting): Contains assets which enables users to get started with Miranum, like extensive examples. 

To collect, prioritise and work on issues we have established a [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/FlowSquad/projects/9).
Following the link you can find all issues of the project. They are prioritised and hopefully well described. If you are interested in working
on one make sure to assign yourself. Do not hesitate to ask any questions in the issue itself. The team is keen to help you. 

In case you want to create a new issue, please do so via the issue-template in the repository your issue is targeted to.

We require an issue for every Pull-Request which is raised in one of the previously mentioned repositories.
