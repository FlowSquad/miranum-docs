# Template support
For easier development of element templates, modellers and developers usually want two things:

1. auto-completion
2. syntax highlighting

The following explains how to easily obtain both in Visual-Studio-Code.

## Automatic completion
The following options are available to obtain automatic completion for element-templates.

### Element templates generated by Miranum-Console
With Miranum-IDE generated element templates automatically contain support for auto-complete in VS-Code.
So you don't have to do anything in this case.

### Own element-templates
If you have your own element-templates you can achieve auto-completion in VS-Code by adding a "$schema" property at the top of the template.
Camunda's schema for element templates can be found at:
[https://unpkg.com/@camunda/element-templates-json-schema/resources/schema.json](https://unpkg.com/@camunda/element-templates-json-schema/resources/schema.json)

It should look like this:
<img src={singleSchema} alt="singleSchema"/>

### Automatic completion for all schemas
With the following steps, you can obtain automatic completion by default in VS-Code:

1. go to your settings in VS-Code (located at: Code/File -> Preferences -> Settings).

2. search for *"JSON"* and click on *"Edit in settings.json"*.
   <img src={jsonSettings} alt="jsonSettings" className="jsonSettings"/>.

3. The settings.json file should open automatically.
You can define custom schemas in *"json.schemas": [...]*.
For this, a new entry must be created as follows:
Create a JavaScript object with the attributes "fileMatch" and "url".
Under *"fileMatch"* you enter something that identifies the files for which the schema is to be applied (usually the file extension).
Under *"url"* you enter the url of the schema you want to use.
In our case, save the following [schema](https://github.com/camunda/element-templates-json-schema/blob/master/packages/element-templates-json-schema/resources/schema.json)
and create an entry for it in settings.json.
This should then look something like this:
<img src={schemaEntry} alt="schemaEntry" className="schemaEntry"/>.

4. Enjoy auto-completion and suggestions by using the key combination: *Ctrl + Space

## JSON Syntax Highlighting
If your element templates do not end in .json, you will need to explain this to VS code first.
For this, please follow steps 1 and 2 as given in [autocompletion-for-all-schemas](#autocompletion-for-all-schemas)
to get to the *"settings.json"*.
In this, file associations can be defined under *"files.associations"*.
So you enter your extension as the key and *".json"* as the value.
Here is an example in which element templates end in *".element-template"*.
<img src={fileAssociations} alt="singleSchema" className="fileAssociations"/>
