# Best Practices Overview

In this section, we share recommended practices for building applications with Miranum Connect. These practices are
derived from our experience working with diverse projects, helping you leverage the full potential of our platform.

Right now, we have focused on explaining the Hexagonal Architecture, a powerful design pattern that promotes clean code
and testability. However, we will continuously add more best practices as we expand our platform's capabilities and usage scenarios.

Best practices are not rules written in stone, but they provide a solid foundation and reduce the chance of creating an
ineffective or complex system. Feel free to adapt these practices based on your specific use case and constraints.
